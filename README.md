### Hi there, I'm Chris


I created a project called Growl, originally called Global Notifications Center, in the early 2000's. I then helped to create Perian. Previously I was Project Manager on Adium. My commit history predates the existence of GitHub or Git, but some of the repos survived and have been migrated here. 

Right now I work on mostly Information Security/CyberSecurity, know a lot about Splunk Process Language and Regular Expressions. The following are a few regular expressions I created which are my favorites.

| My favorite regular expressions|
| -------------------------------- | 
| <a href="https://regex101.com/r/0vuTiN/1/">Find duplicates</a> | <a href="https://regex101.com/r/CnMRJg/14/">Find text wrapped with an asterisk in a unique way</a> |
| <a href="https://regex101.com/r/7Gnbhf/22/">Find the beginning and ending of sentences on a line (the wild horses regex)</a> | <a href="https://regex101.com/r/p4BKOh/27/">Find different types of hashes for crypto types</a> |


The full history of edits for each regex are there so you can see the progression of building these out. I prefer PCRE but am not limited to it, simple for DEFINE and a few other benefits PCRE provides.

Right now I share a repo with others working on making SPL code which shows how to work with SPL. Here is the repo:
